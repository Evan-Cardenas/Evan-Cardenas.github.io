# Evan Cardenas' Portfolio

Hello, I am Evan Cardenas, who is a Computer Engineering major, who wants to graduate in five years, believe it or not.

* Lab 10

I say Lab 10 was one of my favorites because it was incredibly difficult. Using vectors and strings very often was pretty hard and writing the code took a while by itself, without debugging. 
Debugging had a very large problem, we could not make a test as we came across a formatting error that did not make any sense, as we had it correct yet it did not pass formatting.
Linter consistently failed on part 2 and we even stumped the TA’s. After the lab we did figure it out but that was most definitely a difficult yet fun learning experience.

* Lab 1

I was looking back on old labs and am genuinely shocked how we got from writing four lines of code to over fifty. 
But back then it was somehow still completely new to me. I wish it would have stayed this easy all this time.A majority of the workload for this assignment was in the setup of git and github. 
Along with familiarizing with the terminal. I know the coding was meant to just get the ball rolling, not to actually see if we were competent. Anyways still a nice easy introduction to the subject.

* Lab 9

This Lab was straight fun,  I really enjoyed the coding process using bools and vectors, both me and my lab teammate finished in a reasonable time because I feel as if we both thought the lab was
straightforward and easy to follow along. The debugging process was also very smooth.
The fact that this was longer yet still not super difficult was also a very accomplishing feeling as I enjoy looking back at long lines of code.
